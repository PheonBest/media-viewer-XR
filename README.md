# Immersive Experience for Traditional Media using the Apple Vision Pro

The Apple Vision Pro is a mixed reality headset introduced in June 2023.
The goal of this project is to test its capabilities and answer the following question: "Can mixed reality revolutionize the way we experience traditional media?".

This project is divided into three parts:

- [Content Management System](./strapi/README.md) under '/strapi'
- [Database](./db/README.md) under '/db'
- [VisionOS Application](./MediaViewer/README.md) under '/MediaViewer'

To run the app, open MediaViewer/MediaViewer.xcodeproj using Xcode Version 15.1 beta. Then click on the play button.
